## About

An interactive restaurant Menu.

## A Restaurant Menu - with interaction from the user.

You are probably familiar with Restaurant Menus on the internet. However, some restaurants have boring websites, and sometimes, the user needs to take the risk of going to the place. 
This small application offers a little bit more: the user can search the menu for items containing pasta, salad, or even meat.

# Features

üîç This app can be used in every restaurant. You just need to change the pictures and the core menu according to the type of restaurant.
 The design is based on a German Menu Restaurant, but it is possible to make an English version too.
 The user can use a search bar to find items in the menu. The menu automatically loads the items with the pictures and price when the user still writing on it.
 üì± The page loads fast, so make the app more user-friendly.

1. Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-finder-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
  cd restaurant-finder-app

3. Install the dependencies:

   npm install

4.  Start the development server:

   npm start

## Usage

In the initial screen, you can start to search the menu items (In German)
This will automatically load the pictures and the prices together. it also contains a description of the dish(In German)
example: if you write "Pasta" it will load all menu items that contain Pasta. It also works if you write "Getr√§nk" or "Fleisch"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
